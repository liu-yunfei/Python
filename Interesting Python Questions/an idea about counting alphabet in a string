Please read the disclaimer first.

Firstly, create an integer variable to store the English letter number and initialize it into
0.
Then, read the string by the first character.
Transform the character into ASCII code.
If the ASCII code is between 65-122 (including 65 and 122) then the integer variation
plus one.
#That means this character is an English alphabet (including uppercase and
#lowercase)
Then move to the second character While reaching
the end, print the integer variation.
