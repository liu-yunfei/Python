Input an unsigned integer larger than 2
Generate a trial integer
initialize the trial integer into 2
while the input integer is larger the trial integer:
if the input integer can be exactly divided by the trial integer
output “It’s not a prime.”
end the program
else
plus one to the trial integer
output “It’s a prime.”
end the program

My opinion:
I think it is not efficient, because it has to do as many times of adding and dividing as
the input integer value. And we have already known that only even number except 2
can be a prime. so we can just examine the odd number (except 2) and use odd to take
the try. This could decrease about a half of calculating works. 

Add Python code

import sys
TestNumber = int(input("Input an integer: "))
if TestNumber < 2:
    print("Please input an integer which is larger than 2")
    sys.exit(1)
TrialNumber = 2
while TestNumber > TrialNumber:
    if (TestNumber%TrialNumber) == 0:
        print("It's not a prime.")
        sys.exit(0)
    else: 
        TrialNumber = TrialNumber + 1
print("It's a prime.")
